# Self Evaluation

- Reflect on your time management and awareness of where you spend time. Is this a strength or area you are working on? What support do you need in this area? And/or, what tips do you have to share with your classmates in this area? I use todoist, trello and reminder on my phone to manage time. I still need to practice using them and adjust how I plan my time. It wasn't easy process since I don't really know the size of the work and it is hard to allot the right amount of time. Taking note and spend time evaluating how your plan time what go right and wrong and what can be improve. and alway remind yourself that it is a learning and not a fail
- How would you explain to a 5 year old what a function is?
A thing you give a job to and you and keep using the thing to do the same job over and over just like a ziplock bag
- Share your understanding of arguments and parameters.
Parameters is like a placeholder in a function, you define and write your statement using parameters. When you use function, then we put argument, which is real data, function will use in place of parameter. we need to use parameter because we don't know yet what the data is going to be so we need a stand in to write a function and we can reuse these functions else where since now it is dynamic.  
- What questions/topics (related to Functions) do you want to being to your Small Group?
we can put function in our object.
